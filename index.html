    Technical features over technical tricks is the mandate for Mark McMorris and Sebastien Toutant’s latest and greatest project.
  </h3>
    <div class="col m7">
  <p>
    Mark McMorris and Sebastien Toutant are two of the best in the business of slopestyle snowboarding. Their respective bags of tricks are deep enough to consistently land them on podiums of the biggest events in the sport. <p>
    However, just because they can land the gnarliest tricks in snowboarding's history doesn't mean that they want snowboarding to progress in that direction alone. Red Bull Uncorked is their take on growing snowboarding creatively via other means — through the design of insanely technical features rather than technical tricks.

Starting with pen and paper, McMorris and Toutant (with a helping hand from Craig McMorris) poured out their ideas for what terrain parks of the future could potentially look like and brought to life one helluva unique series of features at Grouse Mountain. This is exactly what happens when the focus is 100 percent on the features. Not to say some banger tricks didn't go down, though ...
  </p>

<div class="offset-s1 col s10">
  
   
    <p class="second-half">
      “The main idea was to build fun features that you can be super creative on, or do tricks that are simple,” said Toutant on the project’s inception. “That's what snowboarding’s about. It doesn’t need to be the gnarliest trick every day.”
  </p>
    </div>
    <div class="offset-s1 col s10">
      
  <p class="second-half">
 Mark McMorris added that “we need to show everybody how fun snowboarding is to get more people into the sport, because what we do on a weekend basis [at contests] is not attainable.”
  </p>

    <div class="offset-s1 col s10">

    Yuki Kadono of Japan, Scotty James of Australia and Canadians Mike Ciccarelli and Tyler Nicholson joined Toutant and the McMorris brothers in exploring the possibilities of Red Bull Uncorked.

    McMorris and Toutant worked with Craig McMorris and  Grouse Mountain team to bring their ideas to life on the peak of Vancouver, Canada. When the Prinoth snow groomers were put to rest after 260 hours of build-hours, Scotty James, Yuki Kadono, Tyler Nicholson and Mike Ciccarelli joined the McMorris brothers and Toutant for a week-long session. 
      </p>
    <p class="second-half">
      Here's four of the standout features from McMorris and Toutant's build. 
    </p>  
<h3 class="second-half">
  The Knuckle
    </h3>
 <p class="second-half">While this feature was originally designed to help generate speed through the park, it immediately became a favourite. What's not to love? With long, steep landings, knuckles are a choose-your-adventure feature: go fast and pop early for lengthy hang time, or roll over it. Either way, you've got a low-impact feature that's quite literally fun for the whole family. This knuckle at Red Bull Uncorked saw everything from Mark McMorris's lofty miller flips to extremely technical spins from Seb Toots. Whether you're trying to figure out your first 180, or on the hunt for your umpteenth X Games medal, the knuckle should be high up on the list of features you want at your local mountain.</p>
      
    <h3>
      The Baker's Dozen
    </h3>
    <p class="second-half">
      With three takeoffs, this feature had more to offer than a grab bag of 13 donuts – hence the name. As a next step in the evolution of angled takeoffs, the Baker's Dozen was prime for a whole slew of combinations. Note the lack of kick on the angled pads? That's by design. Hook in with the edge of your choice and pop as little or as much as possible.
    </p>
    <h3 class="second-half" style="font-size: 40px;">
        The Bread Loaf
    </h3>
  <p class="second-half">
    The gap in the takeoff demands precision while adding a new flavour to tried-and-true style of jump. Match transition perfectly or you’re facing impact on an uphill slope before ejecting into the wasteland somewhere between where you were and where you want to be. The technicality of the gap into the lip means you'll have to rethink your bag of tricks. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="second-half">
      The Toutant Transfer
    </h3>
    <p class="second-half">
      Leave it to Toutant to scheme up the most technical of transfer rails. Why should you want this at your local mountain next season? For the hours of frustration-turned-triumph that a technical feature like this presents, of course. In a world where technical features trump technical tricks, the Toutant Transfer deserves to be the proving ground in your local terrain park next winter.

  Snowboarding often seems like it's stuck aboard a spaceship bound for the moon, with progression taking riding another 180 and another flip away from the average rider year after year. While dipping for another flip often makes for good television and a tense contest, it's not exactly the kind of riding that makes you want to strap in and call your drop. That's where Red Bull Uncorked comes in.
  </p>
  <p>
    "We have a lot of fun riding more progressive features and dumbing it down for trick level, but pumping it up in the feature side of things," Mark McMorris said of the thinking behind the custom terrain park.
